# Chicken-Sandwich-Ranker

This was initially a college project I had made. I decided to expand upon it and then upload it here. It's currently not feature-complete.

This project currently uses the following:

PHP
HTML
CSS
SQL
JavaScript

The project's goal is to be a chicken sandwich ranker web application with full CRUD, and authorization and authentication. Many features have been implemented, and the application itself is fully functional locally. Still, I'd like to refine it more, implement more features, and upload it to the web.
