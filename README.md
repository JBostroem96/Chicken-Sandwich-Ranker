# Chicken-Sandwich-Ranker

This was initially a college project I had made. I decided to expand upon it and then upload it here. It's currently not feature-complete.

This project currently uses the following:

PHP<br>
HTML<br>
CSS<br>
SQL<br>
JavaScript<br>

The project's goal is to be an extensive web application with full CRUD, and authorization and authentication. Many features have been implemented, and the application itself is fully functional locally. Still, I'd like to refine it more, implement more features, and upload it to the web.
