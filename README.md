# Chicken-Sandwich-Ranker

This was initially a college project I had made. I decided to expand upon it and then upload it here.

This project has the following features:

It's written in PHP, HTML, CSS (mostly bootstrap), and a little bit of JavaScript.<br>
It ranks submitted chicken sandwiches, displaying the total score, number of ratings, and most importantly, the average rating.<br>
A user needs to be signed in to rate an item. Anyone can view the items.<br>
Only an admin can edit and delete an item.<br>
A user can only rate an item once; however, they can either delete or edit their own rating on their profile.<br>
Anyone can search for a chicken sandwich. Currently the name and the score can be used to filter.<br>
Whether you perform a filtered search or a "view all" search, the rank of the chicken sandwich is displayed.<br>
Anyone can sign up and log in, but there is validation in place where you cannot use an existing user name.<br>
Form validation is mostly achieved through JavaScript.<br>
The submission of a chicken sandwich requires its own image and logo, and there is validation in place so that the same name cannot be used.<br>
A user has their own profile, being able to view their user name, account creation date, and their role.<br>
A user can edit their password. This requires them to re-enter their password, and there is validation in place.<br>
A user can delete their profile.<br>
A user can edit and delete their own ratings, affecting the score of the rated chicken sandwiches.<br>
Updating an item's score should be present wherever it logically makes sense, either due to the deletion of ratings, or a user editing their own rating.<br>

This is currently only a local project.
